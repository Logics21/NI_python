# Old Versions
The first generation of apps was based on [TKinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) and inspired by [example code by DavidFI](https://forums.ni.com/t5/Example-Code/Python-Voltage-Continuous-Input-py/ta-p/3938650). These apps can be found in the [Tkinter](https://github.com/muchaste/NI_python/tree/main/GUI_based/Tkinter) folder - however, they are deprecated and will not be developed anymore.
